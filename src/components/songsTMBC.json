Isaish 'twas foretold it,\nThe Rose I have in mind:\nWith Mary we behold it,\nThe virgin mother kind.\nTo show God's love aright\nShe bore to men a Savior,\nWhen half-gone was the night.\n3.  This Flow'r, whose fragrance tender\nWith sweetness fills the air,\nDispels with glorious splendor,\nThe darkness ev'rywhere.\nTrue man, yet very God,\nFrom sin and death He saves us,\nAnd lightens ev'ry load."

As with gladness men of old\nDid the guiding star behold;\nAs with joy they hailed its light,\nLeading onward, beaming bright,\nSo, most gracious Lord, may we\nEvermore be led to Thee.\n2.  As with joyful steps they sped\nTo that lowly manger bed,\nThere to bend the knee before\nHim whom heav'n and earth adore,\nSo, may we with willing feet,\nEver seek the mercy seat.\n3.  As they offered gifts most rare\nAt the manger rude and bare,\nSo may we with holy joy,\nPure and free from sin's alloy,\nAll our costliest treasures bring,\nChrist, to Thee our heav'nly King.\n4.  Holy Jesus, ev'ry day\nKeep us in the narrow way;\nAnd when earthly things are past,\nBring our ransomed souls at last\nWhere they need no star to guide,\nWhere no clouds Thy glory hide."

Tho' they lead o'er the cold, dark mountains,\nSeeking His sheep,\nOr along by Siloam's fountains,\nHelping the weak.\nFootprints of Jesus that make the pathway glow;\nWe will follow the steps of Jesus where'er they go.\n3. If they lead thro' the temple holy, \nPreaching the Word,\nOr in homes of the poor and lowly,\nServing the Lord.\nFootprints of Jesus that make the pathway glow;\nWe will follow the steps of Jesus where'er they go.\n4.  Then at last, when on high He see us,\nOur journey done,\nWe will rest where the steps of Jesus\nEnd at His throne.\nFootprints of Jesus that make the pathway glow;\nWe will follow the steps of Jesus where'er they go.\n"
